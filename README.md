# Words

**Words** is a collection of safe and unoffensive words. 

## Structure
The repository is organized into three plaintext txt files.
- **Verbs.txt**: Contains a list of verbs.
- **Adjectives.txt**: Contains a list of adjectives.
- **Nouns.txt**: Contains a list of nouns.

## Project Background
I created this list to generate usernames for an application I was working on but feel free to use the repo in any way you want.
There are no words in the list with dashes or other symbols (currently), just words containing only letters.

## Contribution
Suggestions, edits, or additional words/files are more than welcome, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


Feel free to use and share this collection, and I hope it helps!
